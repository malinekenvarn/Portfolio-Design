This is a minimalistic portfolio site. I am building this to practice HTML5, CSS3, CSS Grid and flexbox. I got the design idea from Udemy Youtube channel with the grid of images that darkens when you hover over it with the mouse. This will perform differently on touch screens and mobile devices, I'm not yet finished with those styles. The placeholder picture is a photo made by Clint Patterson.

I choose to have a black background (vampire black) with the Inconsolata font because it reminds me of the Linux terminal, and the blue green  details reminds of the pip boy from the game Fallout.
