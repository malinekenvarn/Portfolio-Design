This is a simple portfolio site for my code and projects. I am building this to practice HTML5, CSS3, CSS Grid and flexbox. I got the design idea from Udemy Youtube channel with the grid of images that darkens when you hover over it. I am not finished with it, I have to add links to my projects, description and find the right pictures on Unsplash. The placeholder is a photo made by Clint Patterson.

I choose to have a black background with the Inconsolata font because it reminds me of the Linux terminal, and the green details reminds of the pip boy from the game Fallout.
