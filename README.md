This is a simple portfolio site for my code and projects. I am building this to practice HTML5, CSS3, CSS Grid and flexbox. I got the design idea from Udemy Youtube channel with the grid of images that darkens when you hover over it. I am not finished, I have not yet decided my font styles and I have to make the site mobile responsive before I use it. And I also have to find the right pictures on Unsplash. The placeholder is a photo made by Clint Patterson.
